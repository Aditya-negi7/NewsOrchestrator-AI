# NewsOrchestrator AI 🤖📰 
## A Multi-Agent AI News Generation System

### 🧠 Overview

This project implements a production-style multi-agent AI system using CrewAI and Google Gemini 1.5 Flash that autonomously researches and generates structured blog articles on emerging trends.

The system simulates collaborative teamwork between AI agents:

🔎 Research Agent – Gathers real-time insights using web search tools

✍️ Writer Agent – Synthesizes research into a structured, engaging article

Unlike many LLM-based projects that rely on expensive APIs, this system is built using free-tier APIs, demonstrating a cost-efficient and scalable AI architecture design.
